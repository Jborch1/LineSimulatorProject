# Portfolio
The repository of my portfolio projects
This project takes in a text file that store the timing for the internal clock and the amount of customers in line in this text file

So the drive will ask the user what is the file you want to use (EX. simple.txt or test2.txt)

From here the driver will then ask if you want to simulate the store using 1 or multiple lines and draw the stats from there


Overall, this project is designed to simulate a line in a store and see what might be better having one large queue or multiple queues. The logitics and format of the code is being updated to this day
however, the entirety of this project is mostly complete with internal comments to help the user understand what is going on in this project
